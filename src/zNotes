when you define a class component, you need to provide 
types for its props and state. 

TypeScript when you create a functional component - you donâ€™t have to provide types for it manually
export const Example = () => {
return <div>Functional component text</div>
}
Here we return a string wrapped into a <div/> element, so TypeScript will automat-
ically conclude that the return type of our function is JSX.Element.


column has children defined in it so in your app.tsx you can nest the card in it
